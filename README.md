# Moon Master (Parody Fan Game)

A fast, silly, 4-bit-style browser game loosely inspired by the “Moon Master” gag from Aqua Teen. It’s a fan-made parody: simple shapes, crunchy SFX, and steadily escalating chaos. Survive waves, fight boss Gorgatron, and spend your score on power-ups to push deeper.

## Play
- **Desktop (recommended):** Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- **Mobile:** The build aims to be mobile-friendly in a single HTML file. Performance and touch controls may vary by device.

> Tip: Some browsers won’t play audio until you’ve pressed a key or tapped the screen.

## Features
- **Retro 4-bit look:** No external assets; everything is drawn as solid-color primitives.
- **Progression & pacing:** New enemy types appear as you advance (e.g., **spaceships from ~Level 7**, **ground crabs from ~Level 15**), with faster projectiles and denser patterns over time.
- **Boss encounters:** **Gorgatron** returns with simple animations and nasty, hammer-bro-style yellow arcs.
- **Shop & power-ups:** Your **score is your currency**. Buy items between waves; key power-ups include **enemy slow** and a **“remove two enemies”** screen clear. Power-ups currently last **~10 seconds**.
- **Checkpoints:** Each level checkpoint appears as a **gold key**.
- **Title flair:** Projectiles orbit and bounce on the **title screen** for ambiance.
- **Debug level select:** On the **title screen, press `L`** to open a basic level-select/debug menu. (Dev/testing only.)

## Controls (current defaults)
- **Move:** Arrow Keys or WASD  
- **Shoot:** Space  
- **Jump:** X (enabled in this build)  
- **Pause:** P  
- **Debug Level Select:** Press **L** on the title screen

> If you changed keybinds in your build, update this section to match your code.

## Gameplay notes
- Colliding with enemies **resets your run** (arcade-style).  
- Difficulty **ramps meaningfully after ~Level 20**.  
- Levels are lightweight and repeatable; expect increasingly dense bullet patterns and tighter dodging.

## How to run / host
- **Local:** Double-click `index.html` (or serve with any static server if your browser blocks local file audio).  
- **Web hosting:** Any static host works—just upload the single HTML file.

## Known issues / quirks
- Audio may require an initial input.  
- On some mobile browsers, touch input and on-screen buttons may overlap UI at small sizes.

## Roadmap / nice-to-haves
- More SFX polish and mix pass  
- Additional enemy patterns between Levels 20–30  
- Optional accessibility toggles (reduced flashing, color variants)  
- Save settings (mute, control hints)
