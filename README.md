# Moon Master HD: Beware the Gorgatron

A fast, silly, 4-bit-style browser game loosely inspired by the “Moon Master” gag from Aqua Teen. It’s a fan-made parody: simple shapes, crunchy SFX, and steadily escalating chaos. Survive waves, fight boss Gorgatron, and spend your score on power-ups to push deeper.

## Play
- **Desktop (recommended):** Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- **Mobile:** The build aims to be mobile-friendly in a single HTML file. Performance and touch controls may vary by device. It is still being refined.

> Tip: Some browsers won’t play audio until you’ve pressed a key or tapped the screen. Currently, the game plays better on desktop with a keyboard.

## Features
- **Retro 4-bit look:** No external assets; everything is drawn as solid-color primitives.
- **Progression & pacing:** New enemy types appear as you advance (e.g., **spaceships from ~Level 7**, **ground crabs from ~Level 15**), with faster projectiles and denser patterns over time.
- **Boss encounters:** **Gorgatron** returns with simple animations and nasty, hammer-bro-style yellow arcs.
- **Shop & power-ups:** Your **score is your currency**. Buy items between waves; key power-ups include **enemy slow** and a **“remove two enemies”** screen clear. Power-ups currently last **~10 seconds**.
- **Checkpoints:** Each level checkpoint appears as a **gold key**.
- **Title flair:** Projectiles orbit and bounce on the **title screen** for ambiance.
- **Debug level select:** On the **title screen, press `L`** to open a basic level-select/debug menu.

## Controls (current defaults)
- **Move:** Arrow Keys or WASD  
- **Shoot:** Space  
- **Jump:** X (enabled in this build)  
- **Pause:** P  
- **Debug Level Select:** Press **L** on the title screen

## Gameplay notes
- Colliding with enemies **resets your run** (arcade-style).  
- Difficulty **ramps meaningfully after ~Level 25**.  
- Levels are lightweight and repeatable; expect increasingly dense bullet patterns and tighter dodging. It is hard, but not impossible. It has been QC'ed, however it is meant to be comically frustrating and should feel like Cuphead or retro shoot-em ups.

## Known issues / quirks
- Audio may require an initial input.
- On some mobile browsers, touch input and on-screen buttons may overlap UI at small sizes. This is still being worked on.

## Roadmap / nice-to-haves
- More SFX polish and mix pass  
- Additional enemy patterns after New Game + modes. 
- Optional accessibility toggles (color variants)  
- Optimize save settings
