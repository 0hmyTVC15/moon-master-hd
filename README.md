# Moon Master HD: Beware the Gorgatron

![boxart](assets/boxart/web_moonmaster.png)

A fast, silly, 4-bit-style browser game loosely inspired by the “Moon Master” gag from Aqua Teen. It’s a fan-made parody: simple shapes, crunchy SFX, and steadily escalating chaos. Survive waves, fight boss Gorgatron, and spend your score on power-ups to push deeper.

## Play
- **Desktop (recommended):** Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- **Mobile:** The build aims to be mobile-friendly in a single HTML file. Performance and touch controls may vary by device. It is still being refined.

> Tip: Some browsers won’t play audio until you’ve pressed a key or tapped the screen. Currently, the game plays better on desktop with a keyboard.

## Features
- **Retro 4-bit look:** No external assets; everything is drawn as solid-color primitives.
- **Progression & pacing:** New enemy types appear as you advance (e.g., **spaceships from ~Level 7**, **ground crabs from ~Level 15**), with faster projectiles and denser patterns over time.
- **Boss encounters:** **Gorgatron** returns with simple animations and nasty, hammer-bro-style yellow arcs.
- **Shop & power-ups:** Your **score is your currency**. Buy items between waves; key power-ups include **enemy slow** and a **“remove two enemies”** screen clear. Power-ups currently last **~10 seconds**.
- **Checkpoints:** Each level checkpoint appears as a **gold key**.
- **Title flair:** Projectiles orbit and bounce on the **title screen** for ambiance.
- **Debug level select:** On the **title screen, press `L`** to open a basic level-select/debug menu.

## Controls
- **Move:** Arrow Keys  
- **Shoot:** Space Bar / X
- **Jump:** Up Arrow Key
- **Level Select:** Press **L** on the title screen

## Gameplay notes
- Colliding with enemies **resets your run** (arcade-style).  
- Difficulty **ramps meaningfully after ~Level 25** as key will start moving.
- Levels are lightweight and repeatable; expect increasingly dense bullet patterns and tighter dodging.
> Tip: It is hard, but not impossible. It is meant to be comically frustrating and should feel like Cuphead or retro shoot-em ups.
